## Purpose
This website is a Countdown to the date Jan 10th.

## User Personas
This website is for myself and my friends, who might be interested in my birthday.

## User Stories
User interaction on the site is minimal, it is purely visual.

## Website structure
There is only one page on this website.

## Page descriptions
The main part of the website is the countdown and it is visible at all times.

## Wireframes
The webpage has a background image with a logo, some text and the countdown timer ontop of it.

## Non-Functional requirements
The website can handle many visitors at once, as it is quite simple and lacks any sort of user interaction.
